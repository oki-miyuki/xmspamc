===========================================================================
  @@FILE is XMailServerFilter parameter.

  tempdir  is temporary directory. 

  on -s option. large value will be looks like hung up. Therefore, 
  we will recommend the thing operated by 250k byte of an initial value. 

  default size is 250k. so large mail pass through by default. -b option 
  is filter to SpamAssassin a part of mail. and reject mail when judged spam.
